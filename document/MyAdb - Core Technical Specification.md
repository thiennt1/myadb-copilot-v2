# MyAdb Application - Core Technical Specification

**Date:** July 11, 2025

---

## 1. Introduction

### Project Overview
MyAdb is a cross-platform utility application (Windows 11 and macOS) built with Python and Tkinter. It provides quick access and control over Android devices via ADB commands, with a dynamically configurable graphical UI. The project strictly follows Clean Architecture for maintainability, testability, and separation of concerns.

### Goals and Objectives
- Deliver a robust, cross-platform ADB GUI with dynamic UI configuration via JSON files.
- Achieve seamless device detection, selection, and management for multiple Android devices.
- Enable safe, fail-tolerant batch command execution with comprehensive logging.
- Support variable substitution and user-prompted input for flexible command workflows.
- Ensure real-time UI updates and configuration editing within the application.
- Maintain high standards of reliability, usability, and performance (UI response < 200ms).
- Facilitate extensibility for future features (themes, device monitoring, presets).

### Target Audience
- **Primary Users:**
  - Android developers automating device management and testing workflows.
  - QA engineers and testers requiring reliable, repeatable device control and logging.
  - Power users managing multiple devices or custom ADB workflows.
- **Secondary Users:**
  - IT support staff handling device provisioning and troubleshooting.
  - Educators and students learning Android development and device interaction.

## 2. System Overview

### Functional Requirements
1. The system shall dynamically generate the UI from a JSON configuration file.
2. The system shall detect connected Android devices and display their status.
3. The system shall allow device selection and target commands to the selected device using `-s [device serial]`.
4. The system shall execute ADB, shell, and system commands, including batch execution and robust error handling.
5. The system shall support variable substitution using global inputs and user prompts.
6. The system shall allow in-app editing, selection, and reloading of JSON configuration files.
7. The system shall provide device control buttons (Back, Home, Multitask, Power, Volume, Rotate, Keyboard, Screen, Camera, Video).
8. The system shall log all command executions, outputs, errors, and system events in a timestamped format.
9. The system shall provide a clear log functionality.
10. The system shall maintain UI responsiveness during command execution (threading).

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:**
  - UI response time < 200ms for all user interactions.
  - Device detection and refresh < 1 second.
- **Scalability:**
  - Support for up to 10 simultaneously connected devices.
  - Handle batch execution of up to 20 commands per button.
- **Security:**
  - Restrict file operations to user-accessible directories.
  - Sanitize all user inputs and command arguments.
- **Usability:**
  - Intuitive, consistent UI layout with clear feedback and error reporting.
  - Real-time updates for configuration changes and device status.
- **Reliability:**
  - Fail-safe command execution (continue on error, log all outcomes).
  - Robust error handling for device disconnects, command failures, and config errors.

### User Stories
- As a developer, I want to define custom button layouts in JSON so I can automate frequent ADB tasks.
- As a tester, I want to select a device and execute batch commands so I can run test scenarios efficiently.
- As a power user, I want to edit the configuration file in-app so I can quickly adjust my workflow.
- As a QA engineer, I want to view detailed logs of all command executions so I can diagnose issues.
- As IT support, I want to refresh the device list so I can manage newly connected devices.
