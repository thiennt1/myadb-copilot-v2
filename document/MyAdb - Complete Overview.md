# MyAdb Application - Complete Overview

**Date: July 11, 2025**

## 1. Introduction

MyAdb is a cross-platform utility application (Windows 11 and macOS) built with Python and Tkinter. Its primary purpose is to provide users with quick access and control over Android devices via ADB (Android Debug Bridge) commands. It simplifies repetitive tasks by offering a dynamically configurable graphical user interface, reducing the need for manual command-line interaction. The application strictly follows Clean Architecture for maintainability, testability, and separation of concerns.

## 2. Core Requirements Summary

- **Platform Compatibility:** Runs on Windows 11 and macOS.
- **Architecture:** Clean Architecture (Uncle Bob) with clear separation between UI and business logic.
- **Testability:** Robust unit testing for all logical components, independent of UI and external dependencies.
- **Device Management:**
  - Automatically lists all connected Android devices (`adb devices`).
  - Device selection via dropdown; all subsequent ADB commands target the selected device using `-s [device serial]`.
  - If no device is selected, commands run without targeting a specific device.
- **Dynamic UI (JSON-driven):**
  - Scrollable grid of buttons defined by an external JSON configuration file.
  - UI reloads on JSON file changes (on app resume focus or explicit reload).
  - Informative error dialog on JSON parsing/loading failure.
  - Layout title from JSON displayed prominently.
- **Global Inputs:**
  - JSON config includes `globalInput` for dynamic key-value pairs.
  - Displayed in a dedicated UI section; substitutable in command arguments using `%variable_name` format.
- **Command Execution:**
  - Buttons execute functions based on JSON `function.name`:
    - `reload`: Reloads UI from JSON file.
    - `install_apk_from_dialog`: Prompts for APK file and runs `adb install`.
    - `cmd`: Executes a list of shell/ADB commands sequentially. Supports:
      1. ADB commands with 'adb' prefix (system strips prefix before execution)
      2. Direct ADB commands without prefix
      3. Windows shell commands (starting with 'cmd.exe' or 'powershell')
      4. Windows applications (e.g., `"C:\Program Files\Notepad++\notepad++.exe" file.txt`)
      5. Local system commands (platform independent)
    - Robust command execution: continues executing remaining commands even if one fails; errors are logged and summarized.
    - Variable substitution: `%variable_name` for global inputs and `%<inputid>` for user-prompted input.
    - Special handling for paths with spaces and quoted arguments.
    - `clear_log`: Clears the application's log area directly via UI.

## 3. UI Features and Layout

- **App Title:** "MyAdb - [Version]" at the top.
- **Layout Header:** Displays `config.layoutTitle` (bold, red), device dropdown, and refresh button.
- **Device Control Buttons:** Panel for common ADB `input keyevent` commands (Back, Home, Multitask, Power, Volume, Rotate, Keyboard, Screen, Camera, Video).
- **Global Input Display:** Shows `globalInput` key-value pairs.
- **JSON File Management:** Current JSON path, "Edit" (external editor), "Change" (select new JSON), "Reload" (refresh config).
- **Dynamic Button Grid:** Main interactive area, scrollable.
- **Log Area:** Scrollable panel at the bottom with timestamped command output and status messages.
- **Layout Proportions:**
  - Buttons area (right frame): 70% width
  - Device control area (left frame): 30% width
  - Log area: 100% width at bottom
  - See `UI_Layout_Specification.md` for details

## 4. Architecture & Design Principles

- **Clean Architecture Layers:**
  - **Domain:** Entities and use cases (business logic, independent of frameworks)
  - **Interfaces:** Abstract contracts (Gateways, Presenters, Commands)
  - **Infrastructure:** Concrete implementations for ADB, file system, OS processes
  - **Presentation:** Tkinter UI and presenter logic
- **Dependency Inversion Principle:** High-level modules depend on abstractions
- **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each module/class has one responsibility
- **Unit Testability:** All logic testable in isolation
- **Model-View-Presenter (MVP):**
  - Model: Data structures (JSON config, device list, log messages)
  - View: Tkinter widgets
  - Presenter: UI logic, interacts with use cases
- **Command Pattern:** Button actions as command objects
- **Observer Pattern:** Logging and UI reload notifications
- **Strategy Pattern:** Command execution strategies for different OS
- **Dependency Injection:** All dependencies injected
- **Robust Error Handling:** Informative error dialogs and log messages
- **Concurrency/Threading:** Blocking operations run in separate threads; UI updates marshaled to main thread
- **Configuration Management:** Centralized app settings
